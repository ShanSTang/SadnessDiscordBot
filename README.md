This contains the analyzer which uses models you can find here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KkqJVMp6MkKHkkQ-F2D9luCC7iJ9ztGi?usp=sharing
If you're running this in collab, you'll also need to download those models. These models were selected after multiple times of running the training set. They were chosen for having higher training loss while still having high accuracy since it did appear that it started being overfitting after a little (so getting more accurate within the set trained on but bad on any new stuff). 

The models were trained in the file: sadnessAnalyzerTraining.ipynb using data found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hyunkic/twitter-depression-dataset?select=clean_non_d_tweets.csv.
