This contains the analyzer which uses models you can find here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KkqJVMp6MkKHkkQ-F2D9luCC7iJ9ztGi?usp=sharing
If you're running this in collab, you'll also need to download those models. 

The models were trained in the file: sadnessAnalyzerTraining.ipynb using data found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hyunkic/twitter-depression-dataset?select=clean_non_d_tweets.csv.
